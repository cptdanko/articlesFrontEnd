# Articles API Front end

Front end for Spring Boot based [Articles API] RESTful backend. At this stage, it only includes a React implementation of showing the data retrieved from the backend.

>p.s. Part of a tutorial on [My Day To-Do Blog], this is a REST API that exposes endpoints to create and retrieve articles. 
## Setup
To start the react front-end
1. Clone the repository
2. In the terminal navigate to the react directory ``` cd react```, run
```
npm install
````
3. If you see an error, create a .env file in the react directory with the following
```
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true 
```
4. Once done, then execute ```  npm start```

And that's all, a full client-side app to consume data from the Articles API is ready to display the articles.
